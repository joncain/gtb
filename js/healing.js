We showed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 expression was downregulated in HTS compared with normal skin from the same patients, whereas type 1 and 3 collagen and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were upregulated. These differences, however, were not seen in cultured fibroblasts, suggesting the involvement of microenvironmental factors in the pathogenesis of HTS. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) highly upregulated the expression of MMP-1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in both HTS-derived and control fibroblasts; the upregulation was reversed by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors. An animal study using human HTS tissue implanted into nude mice indicated that controlled-release FGF-2 resulted in significantly less weight and decreased hydroxyproline content in HTS. Degradation of collagen fibers in FGF-2-treated HTS was also confirmed histologically. Western blotting showed that FGF-2-treated HTS expressed significantly higher MMP-1 protein than control. Decreased MMP-1 expression may be an important transcriptional change in HTS, and its reversal as well as upregulation of HGF by FGF-2 could be a new therapeutic approach for HTS.\r\rEto H, Suga H, Aoi N, Kato H, Doi K, Kuno S, Tabata Y, Yoshimura K.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946856</a>\r"

This study is the first to use FGF-2(-/-) mice to further address the involvement of FGF-2 in the disease process. We demonstrate that immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 induces more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in FGF-2(-/-) mice compared with FGF-2(+/+) mice. The antigen-specific cytokine response to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide and the degree of central nervous system inflammation was similar in both groups. However, FGF-2(-/-) mice displayed increased infiltration of CD8(+) T cells and macrophages/microglia. In addition, nerve fibre degeneration and axonal loss were augmented, whereas the extent of remyelination in central nervous system lesions was reduced. FGF-2 has been associated with the induction of demyelination and the inhibition of myelin production by oligodendrocytes. Our study supports the opposing notion that FGF-2 can also assert a neuro-protective function. This may be particularly appealing when it comes to targeting the neurodegenerative aspect of multiple sclerosis.\r\rRottlaender A, Villwock H, Addicks K, Kuerten S.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21564095</a>\r"

Such research has contributed to significant developments in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and has considerably advanced our understanding of the neurobiology of learning and memory in general. A number of recent studies have examined the role of growth factors in the formation of long-term memory for fearful events, due to their ability to cause morphological neural changes in response to environmental stimulation. In this review we first describe physiological evidence that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) receptors are highly expressed in the neural circuitry regulating fear acquisition and extinction, and that FGF2 modulates the molecular signals known to be involved in the formation of fear memories. Then we present emerging behavioral research that demonstrates that exogenous FGF2 can enhance the formation of fear conditioning and extinction memories. Finally, we briefly discuss how research into the role of FGF2 in learning and memory may be of clinical benefit, particularly in the treatment of anxiety disorders.\r\rGraham BM, Richardson R.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624434</a>\r"

It is difficult, however, to pinpoint whether these alterations are a cause or consequence of the disorder. The present study asks whether FGF2 administered the day after birth has long-lasting effects on hippocampal development and emotionality. We show that early-life FGF2 shifts the pace of neurogenesis, with an early acceleration around weaning followed by a deceleration in adulthood. This, in turn, results in a denser dentate gyrus with more neurons. To assess the impact of early-life FGF2 on emotionality, we use rats selectively bred for differences in locomotor response to novelty. Selectively bred low-responder (bLR) rats show low levels of novelty-induced locomotion and exhibit high levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared with their selectively bred high-responder counterparts. Early-life FGF2 decreased anxiety-like behavior in highly anxious bLRs without altering other behaviors and without affecting high-responder rats. Laser capture microscopy of the dentate gyrus followed by microarray analysis revealed genes that were differentially expressed in bLRs exposed to early-life FGF2 vs. vehicle-treated bLRs. Some of the differentially expressed genes that have been positively associated with anxiety were down-regulated, whereas genes that promote cell survival were up-regulated. Overall, these results show a key role for FGF2 in the developmental trajectory of the hippocampus as well as the modulation of anxiety-like behavior in adulthood, and they point to potential downstream targets for the treatment of anxiety disorders.\r\rTurner CA, Clinton SM, Thompson RC, Watson SJ Jr, Akil H.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21518861</a>\r"

Emulsion electrospinning was adopted to imbed basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) into ultrafine fibers with a core-sheath structure to promote the wound healing process. An initially burst release as low as 14.0 ± 2.2% was achieved, followed by gradual release for around 4 wk. In vitro investigations on mouse embryo fibroblasts indicated that bFGF-loaded fibrous mats enhanced cell adhesion, proliferation, and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM). Skin wounds were created in the dorsal area of diabetic rats for in vivo evaluation of skin regeneration after covered with bFGF-loaded fibrous mats. Compared with fibrous mats infiltrated with free bFGF, bFGF-loaded scaffolds revealed significantly higher wound recovery rate with complete re-epithelialization and regeneration of skin appendages. Higher density and mature capillary vessels were generated during 2 wk after treatment with bFGF-loaded fibers, and there was no fiber fragment observed in the histological sections at week 4 after operation. The gradual release of bFGF from fibrous mats enhanced collagen deposition and ECM remodeling, and the arrangement and component of collagen fibers were similar to normal tissues. The above results demonstrate the potential use of bFGF-loaded electrospun fibrous mats to rapidly restore the structural and functional properties of wounded skin for patients with diabetic mellitus.\r\rYang Y, Xia T, Zhi W, Wei L, Weng J, Zhang C, Li X.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21402405</a>\r"

An easy and reproducible method has not yet been established for an objective analysis of color changes; therefore, we tested a hand-held color analyzer (NF-333; Nippon Denshoku Co.

Two groups were prospectively divided with 20 (11 females and nine males) patients per group. One group received skin grafting plus basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) spray daily and the other group received only skin grafting. The patients were randomized by the date of their first visit to our hospital. Patients were treated with bFGF on odd days, while patients who came on even days were included in the non-bFGF-treated group. The donor site for skin grafting was the lateral thighs and the thickness was similar in both groups. The results were compared at 1-year posttreatment follow-up. Clinical and objective assessments of the scars were performed 1 to years after complete healing. Color change differentials in comparison with the surrounding skin were lower with bFGF treatment in all parameters (p<0.01), along with clinical assessment with the Vancouver Scar Scale; therefore, the treatment contribute to a better color match with skin grafting postoperatively.\r\rAkita S, Akino K, Yakabe A, Tanaka K, Anraku K, Yano H, Hirano A.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20868384</a>\r"

Since fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) has angiogenic effects, its delivery to the injured spinal cord may attenuate the tissue damage associated with ischemia. To limit systemic mitogenic effects, FGF2 was delivered to the spinal cord via a gel of hyaluronan and methylcellulose (HAMC) injected into the intrathecal space, and compared to controls receiving HAMC alone and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) alone. Dynamic perfusion computed tomography (CT) was employed for the first time in small animals to serially measure blood flow and permeability in the injured and uninjured spinal cord. Spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) and permeability-surface area (PS) measurements were obtained near the injury epicenter, and at two regions rostral to the epicenter in animals that received a 26-g clip compression injury. As predicted, SCBF measurements decreased and PS increased after injury. FGF2 delivered via HAMC after injury restored SCBF towards pre-injury values in all regions, and increased blood flow rates at 7 days post-injury compared to pre-injury measurements. PS was stabilized at regions rostral to the epicenter of injury when FGF2 was delivered with HAMC, with significantly lower values than aCSF controls at 7 days in the region farthest from the epicenter. Laminin staining for blood vessels showed a qualitative increase in vessel density after 7 days when FGF2 was locally delivered. Additionally, permeability stains showed that FGF2 moderately decreased permeability at 7 days post-injury. These data demonstrate that localized delivery of FGF2 improves spinal cord hemodynamics following injury, and that perfusion CT is an important technique to serially measure these parameters in small animal models of spinal cord injury.\r\rKang CE, Clarkson R, Tator CH, Yeung IW, Shoichet MS.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20799884</a>\r"

The main reason for this pain is the degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD), particularly of the nucleus pulposus (NP). For the early degeneration stage, a cell-based therapy could constitute a minimally invasive method of treatment. Therefore, adequate cells are needed. As the usage of NP cells is limited because of their insufficient amount or vitality, a promising alternative is the application of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)\r \rOBJECTIVE:\rTo investigate the potential of various growth factors to induce the differentiation of hMSCs into NP cells and thereby to obtain an alternative cell source for the treatment of IVD degeneration.\r \rMETHODS:\rhMSC-TERT were cultivated three-dimensionally in a hydrogel for 21 days to form NP cells. Cell survival and proliferation were determined using SybrGreen/propidium iodide double staining and the WST-test. To investigate the ability of several growth factors to differentiate hMSCs into NP cells, fluorescence immunostaining of NP-specific marker proteins (e.g., chondroadherin (CHAD) and the recently discovered cytokeratin 19) were performed.\r \rRESULTS:\rFollowing the procedure described above, cells are able to maintain their viability and proliferation capacity throughout the cultivation time. By using a previously established immunofluorescence protocol, we were able to indicate the ability of three different growth factors for differentiating hMSCs into NP-like cells.\r \rCONCLUSION:\rThe expression of several marker proteins in all differentiation experiments indicates the ability of IGF-1, FGF-2 and PDGF-BB to differentiate hMSCs into NP-like cells apart from the usually applied TGF-beta3. Furthermore, our findings preclude the application of Cytokeratin 19 as a specific marker protein for NP cells. Further experiments have to be done to find real specific NP marker proteins to indisputably verify the differentiation of hMSCs into NP cells. If so, application of these three growth factors would possibly be an option to obtain sufficient NP cells for minimally invasive IVD regeneration.\r\rEhlicke F, Freimark D, Heil B, Dorresteijn A, Czermak P.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20458694</a>\r"

A delivery system for local treatment is required to increase efficacy because of its short half-life. However, little is known about the effects of cyclical local injection of bFGF.

To evaluate facial nerve regeneration, the number of myelinated fibers evident on histologic sections was counted on the 14th (7 experimental and 8 control animals) and the 28th days (7 experimental and 6 control animals) after surgery, and the facial movements of vibrissae and the blink reflex were evaluated on alternate days until the 28th day.\r \rRESULTS:\rOn histologic evaluation, the number of myelinated fibers was similar between groups on the 14th day and greater in the group that received bFGF on the 28th day. Behavioral evaluation showed that the animals of the bFGF group presented better functional results between the 6th and 16th days for the blink test and the 14th to the 16th days for vibrissae movements.\r \rCONCLUSION:\rThis study showed that the regeneration of the facial nerve occurred earlier and resulted in significantly more myelinated nerve fibers in the animals that received topical bFGF.\r\rToledo RN, Borin A, Cruz OL, Ho PL, Testa JR, Fukuda Y.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19887987</a>\r"

Skin lesions sometimes ulcerate because of severe ischemia and become intractable when complicated by bacterial infection. We report a rare case of CSS, characterized by a nonhealing ischemic skin ulcer of the right calf with bacterial infection resistant to antibiotics. After sterile maggot debridement therapy, 2 skin autografts failed. Subsequently, a slow-release formula of basic fibroblast growth factor incorporated in biodegradable gelatin hydrogel was administered into the calf muscles to induce vascular regeneration. The ulcer eventually healed with no recurrence. This report describes the use of controlled-release basic fibroblast growth factor for an ischemic leg ulcer in a patient with CSS, suggesting a possible therapeutic role of this novel neovascularization therapy in treating severe skin lesions complicating autoimmune vasculitis syndromes.\r\rKawanaka H, Takagi G, Miyamoto M, Tara S, Takagi I, Takano H, Yasutake M, Tabata Y, Mizuno K.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19701077</a>\r"

A total of 150 patients with non-ischaemic diabetic ulcers measuring 900 mm2 or less were randomized into a placebo group (n = 51), a 0.001% bFGF group (n = 49) and a 0.01% bFGF group (n = 50), and 148 of these patients received treatment for 8 weeks or less. The efficacy evaluation was carried out on 139 patients who met the protocol in this trial. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients showing 75% or greater reductions in the area of ulcer.

It has previously been shown that, when expanded in medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), hMSCs show enhanced chondrogenesis (CG). Previous work concluded that the enhancement of CG could be attributed to the selection of a cell subpopulation with inherent chondrogenic potential. In this study, we show that FGF-2 pretreatment actually primed hMSCs to undergo enhanced CG by increasing basal Sox9 protein levels. Our results show that Sox9 protein levels were elevated within 30 minutes of exposure to FGF-2 and progressively increased with longer exposures. Further, we show using flow cytometry that FGF-2 increased Sox9 protein levels per cell in proliferating and non-proliferating hMSCs, strongly suggesting that FGF-2 primes hMSCs for subsequent CG by regulating Sox9. Indeed, when hMSCs were exposed to FGF-2 for 2 hours and subsequently differentiated into the chondrogenic lineage using pellet culture, phosphorylated-Sox9 (pSox9) protein levels became elevated and ultimately resulted in an enhancement of CG. However, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Sox9 during hMSC expansion was unable to negate the prochondrogenic effects of FGF-2, suggesting that the FGF-2-mediated enhancement of hMSC CG is only partly regulated through Sox9. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which FGF-2 regulates predifferentiation hMSCs to undergo enhanced CG.\r\rHandorf AM, Li WJ.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21818404</a>\r"

Further clinical progress requires a greater understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying fear inhibition. In this study, we examined, for the first time, the effects of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), a mitogen involved in the molecular cascade of memory, on extinction and relapse in rats. In all experiments, rats were first trained to fear a white noise-conditioned stimulus, and then had this learned fear extinguished the following day. Extinction is the process underlying exposure-based therapy in humans. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that FGF2 facilitated the loss of learned fear (ie, extinction) when given either prior to or immediately after extinction but not when given 4 h after extinction. This suggests that FGF2 must be present during the consolidation of the extinction memory to have an effect. Experiment 3 further supported this interpretation by showing that short-term extinction must occur for FGF2 to facilitate long-term extinction, suggesting that FGF2 is facilitating the translation of memory from short-term to long-term storage. In experiment 4 rats given FGF2 immediately after extinction exhibited less shock-induced reinstatement, which is a model preparation of relapse, than did vehicle-treated rats. Together, these experiments demonstrate that FGF2 facilitates extinction and attenuates relapse. Thus, FGF2 may be a novel pharmacological adjunct to exposure therapy.\r\rGraham BM, Richardson R.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19225454</a>\r"

However, little is known about the signals that give rise to or regulate these structural changes. In this article we propose that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), a mitogen for several cell types, may be one of the molecular signals critically involved in the structural changes underlying long-term memory. If FGF2 is part of the signalling cascade involved in long-term memory, then increasing the activation of FGF2 should facilitate memory. In Experiments 1 and 2, we demonstrated that systemic injection of FGF2 (20ng/g of body weight) facilitated memory for contextual fear in 16, 19, and 22 day old male Sprague Dawley rats. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the observed facilitation of memory was not due to FGF2 increasing rats' sensitivity to footshock. These results implicate FGF2 as a possible molecular signal in long-term memory, and further, illustrate a novel means of enhancing memory.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19135539</a>\r"

Both maximal scar extension and the ratio of scar retraction to maximal scar extension, elasticity, by Cutometer were significantly greater in bFGF-treated scars than non-bFGF-treated scars (0.23 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.14 +/- 0.06 mm, 0.59 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.49 +/- 0.15 mm: scar extension, scar elasticity, bFGF vs. non-bFGF, p<0.01). The durometer reading was significantly lower in bFGF-treated scars than in non-bFGF-treated scars (16.2 +/- 3.8 vs. 29.3 +/- 5.1, p<0.01). Transepidermal water loss, water content, and corneal thickness were significantly less in bFGF-treated than in non-bFGF-treated scars (p<0.01).\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19128258</a>\r"

Although modern angiogenic therapies have been used in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive diseases, a regimen combining novel angiogenic therapy and classic nerve blocks, including sympathectomy, has not been discussed to date. In this case report, we present two patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease who were first treated with medication and lumbar sympathectomy, and then with a novel gelatin hydrogel drug-delivery system loaded with basic fibroblast growth factor. The gelatin hydrogel combined with recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor was injected intramuscularly into the ischemic limbs. In the first patient, with arteriosclerosis obliterans, a foot ulcer was healed, and the original score for resting pain (visual analogue scale, 5/10) was decreased to 0/10. In the second patient, with Buerger's disease, a large toe ulcer was healed, and his resting pain (visual analogue scale, 8/10) was decreased to 1/10. Some other parameters, such as skin surface temperature, transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure, and pain-free walking distance, were also improved in both patients after the combined therapy. A multimodal approach is necessary to treat severe ischemic pain. Novel angiogenic therapy combined with nerve blocks seems to be a promising option in patients with severe pain.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19011787</a>\r"

The models were divided into two groups randomly: the bFGF trial group and the normal saline control group. Each group had forty-eight rats. The other forty-eight neonatal Wistar rats were taken into the sham operation group. Forty rats were taken from each group and sacrificed on the 4 th, 7 th, 10 th, 17 th and 24 th days after the operation, respectively, The pathological changes in the brain were observed by optical microscope and the expressions of nestin and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) in hippocampal CA1 region were examined with immunohistochemical staining and image quantitative analysis on the 4 th, 7 th, 10 th, 17 th and 24 th days after the operation. The spatial cognitive capability of other eight rats which were taken from each group respectively was evaluated by using the Morris water maze at the age of 30 days.\r \rRESULTS:\r(1) No brain damage was found in the sham operation group, the neurocytes were degenerative and necrotic in the control group of normal saline. The pathological manifestation of the brain damage in the bFGF trial group was milder than that of the normal saline control group. (2) Expression of nestin: The number of nestin-positive cells in hippocampal CA1 region of control group on the 4 th, 7 th, 10 th, 17 th and 24 th days after the operation was significantly increased compared with that of the sham operation group at all time points, and the numbers of nestin-positive cells in hippocampal CA1 region of the trial group were higher than those of the sham operation group and the control group (P < 0.01). (3) The expression of GAP-43 in hippocampal CA1 region of the neonatal rats reached peak on the 10th day after the operation in all the three groups. The integral optical density (IOD) of GAP-43 in hippocampal CA1 region of the control group was higher than that of the sham-operation group at all time points, and the IOD of GAP-43 in hippocampal CA1 region of the trial group was higher than those of the sham operation group and the control group at all time points (P < 0.01 for all). (4) The latency to escape platform in control group (51.75 +/- 11.27s) was longer than that in trial group (40.32 +/- 11.48s) and the sham operation group (36.58 +/- 10.83s) (P < 0.05); the frequency of passing through the platform in control group (2.34 +/- 2.42) was less than that in trial group (5.08 +/- 3.86) and the sham operation group (7.03 +/- 3.62) (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the trial group and the sham operation group (P > 0.05).\r \rCONCLUSIONS:\r(1) The expression of nestin and GAP-43 increased in hippocampal CA1 region of neonatal rats with HIBD, it may be involved in the activation of neural stem cells and the regeneration of neurocytes after HIBD. (2) The treatment with bFGF can improve the ability of learning and memory of neonatal rats with HIBD. (3) Exogenous bFGF could enhance the expression of nestin and GAP-43 in the brain of neonatal rats with HIBD, which may play an important role in restoration of neurons damaged due to hypoxia-ischemia.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17697621</a>\r"

To gain further insight into the potential of bFGF for systemic therapy in osteoporosis, we investigated the responsiveness of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) explanted from 7-month-old normal and ovariectomized (OVX) rats that were intravenously treated with a low dose of bFGF (25 microg/kg) for 2 weeks. The BMSCs were obtained using femoral aspiration and maintained in an osteogenic medium. The amount of cells recovered from bFGF-treated rats was lower than that from saline-treated rats, and proliferation of the cells was markedly less for the bFGF-treated rats. The BMSCs from the bFGF-treated rats also showed lower levels of specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (ALP/deoxyribonucleic acid) and mineralization. Expression of the extracellular matrix proteins critical for mineralization, in particular osteopontin, was greater for bFGF-treated cells from both types of animals in the first week of culture, after which the expression of all markers significantly declined. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry analyses of the tibiae showed an increase in bone mineral density after bFGF treatment only for OVX rats. We conclude that osteoprogenitor cells were depleted from the marrow of bFGF-treated rats, most likely because of the stimulatory effect of bFGF on bone formation.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17394387</a>\r"

We undertook this study to investigate the possible role of FGF-2 in aggrecan catabolism by aggrecanase in human articular cartilage.\r \rMETHODS:\rAggrecan catabolism was induced by interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) in normal human articular cartilage and assessed by measuring the release of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and aggrecanase-dependent fragments by Western blotting with antibodies against neoepitopes. ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 3, and 13 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1 and 3 was measured by Western blotting. IL-6 and IL-8 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Proteoglycan synthesis was monitored by 35S-sulfate incorporation.\r \rRESULTS:\rIL-1alpha caused cleavage of aggrecan in cultured human articular cartilage explants, with release of GAG and aggrecan fragments containing ARGS and AGEG neoepitopes. This was inhibited by FGF-2 (1-100 ng/ml). Tumor necrosis factor alpha and retinoic acid also stimulated release of neoepitope, and this was also suppressed by FGF-2. IL-1alpha induced ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 mRNA in primary human chondrocytes, and this was inhibited by FGF-2. IL-1alpha-induced aggrecan breakdown was inhibited by TIMP-1 or by the N-terminal portion of TIMP-3, although FGF-2 did not affect production of the inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 when IL-1alpha was present. FGF-2 did not prevent IL-1alpha suppression of proteoglycan synthesis and did not negate its ability to stimulate the production of IL-6, IL-8, and MMPs 1, 3, and 13.\r \rCONCLUSION:\rOur findings suggest that FGF-2 may play a chondroprotective role in human articular cartilage by controlling the expression and activity of the aggrecanases ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18975307</a>\r"

One of three dosages (200, 400 or 800 microg) of rhFGF-2 in a biodegradable gelatin hydrogel was injected during surgery into the osteotomy site of 59 knee osteoarthritis patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy, and 57 of them were monitored for 16 weeks. The rhFGF-2 dose dependently increased the percentage of patients with radiographic bone union, and decreased the average time needed for such union. The percentages of patients with an absence of pain and full-weight bearing were also greater in the higher dosage groups than in the low dosage group, especially in the clinically critical periods 6, 8, and 10 weeks. Neither blood chemistries nor clinical adverse events were associated with the rhFGF-2 dosages. We therefore conclude that the rhFGF-2 in gelatin hydrogel dose dependently accelerated radiographic bone union of a surgical osteotomy with a safety profile at least at the dosages used, suggesting the clinical efficacy of this agent for bone repair.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17205557</a>\r"

We investigated the effects of bFGF on diabetic neuropathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetic rats were treated with human recombinant bFGF as follows: 1) intravenous administration, 2) intramuscular injection into thigh and soleus muscles with cross-linked gelatin hydrogel (CGH), and 3) intramuscular injection with saline. Ten or 30 days later, the motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) of the sciatic-tibial and caudal nerves, sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, sciatic nerve blood flow (SNBF), and retinal blood flow (RBF) were measured. Delayed MNCV in the sciatic-tibial and caudal nerves, hypoalgesia, and reduced SNBF in diabetic rats were all ameliorated by intravenous administration of bFGF after 10, but not 30, days. Intramuscular injection of bFGF with CGH also improved sciatic-tibial MNCV, hypoalgesia, and SNBF after 10 and 30 days, but caudal MNCV was not improved. However, intramuscular injection of bFGF with saline had no significant effects. bFGF did not significantly alter RBF in either normal or diabetic rats. These observations suggest that bFGF could have therapeutic value for diabetic neuropathy and that CGH could play important roles as a carrier of bFGF.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16644707</a>\r"

Recently, the popularity of spinal fusion leads to more opportunities to obtain disc specimens, which could be applied to explore the pathogenesis of disc degeneration with modern biologic techniques.\r \rMETHODS:\rThere were 21 specimens of lumbar intervertebral discs from 15 patients with discogenic low back pain during posterior lumbar interbody fusion, 16 aging discs from patients without low back pain, and 10 normal discs as control collected for the study of their histopathologic features, as well as the expressions of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and its receptor (Flg), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and its receptor (TGF-betaRI) by immunohistochemistry. The distribution of macrophages and mast cells was also noted. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was assessed to evaluate proliferating activities of disc cells.\r \rRESULTS:\rThe distinct histologic characteristic of the disc from the patient with discogenic low back pain was the ingrowth of vascularized granulation tissue along torn fissures, extending from the external layer of the anulus fibrosus into the nucleus pulposus. The immunohistochemical staining showed that there were strong expressions of bFGF and TGF-beta1 and their receptors, as well as a strong expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the zones of granulation tissue in the painful discs. However, there were only weak expressions in the nongranulation tissue zones in the painful discs and aging discs, and no expression in the control discs. In addition, abundant macrophages and mast cells were found in the granulation tissue zones of painful discs but absent in the nongranulation tissue zones of painful discs or aging discs and the normal control discs.\r \rCONCLUSIONS:\rThe findings indicated that degeneration of the painful disc might originate from the injury and subsequent repair of anulus fibrosus. Growth factors, such as bFGF and TGF-beta1, macrophages and mast cells might play a key role in the repair of the injured anulus fibrosus and subsequent disc degeneration.\r \rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16508552</a>\r\rPeng B, Hao J, Hou S, Wu W, Jiang D, Fu X, Yang Y.\r"

Therefore, we evaluated whether fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and/or heparin, which induce angiogenesis, may affect cardiac function in the setting of HHD. We used Dahl salt sensitive (DS) rats as an HHD model. Direct intramyocardial injection of 100 microg of FGF-2 plus 1.28 microg of heparin (n = 6), 100 microg of FGF-2 (n = 6), 1.28 microg of heparin (n = 6) or saline (n = 6) were performed in 9-week-old rats. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate cardiac function at 9, 11, and 13 weeks of age. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations were measured at 8 and 13 weeks of age. DS rats were killed 4 weeks after myocardial injection (at 13 weeks of age), and myocardial capillary density was assessed by von Willebrand factor staining. Injection of FGF-2 plus heparin significantly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P < 0.0001) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (P < 0.0001), significantly improved the reduction of left ventricular fractional shortening (P = 0.0005), significantly decreased plasma ANP (P < 0.0001) and BNP (P = 0.016) concentrations, and significantly increased myocardial capillary density (P = 0.0002) compared with injection of saline. These findings indicate that intramyocardial injection of FGF-2 plus heparin suppresses the progression of cardiac failure in DS rats.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham surgery or ovariectomy at 3 months of age and maintained untreated for 2 months after surgery. Polyurethane catheters were then inserted in the jugular veins of all rats for daily intravenous treatments with vehicle or bFGF at doses of 100 or 200 microg/kg for 7 or 14 days. Other groups of ovx rats were killed at 7 or 14 days after withdrawal of treatment with the higher dose of bFGF. Quantitative bone histomorphometry was performed in undecalcified cross sections of the tibial diaphysis. Cortical bone area was nearly the same in vehicle-treated control and ovx rats, but a small, statistically significant increase in this structural variable was observed in ovx rats treated with both doses of bFGF. This small increase in cortical bone area was maintained at 7 days after withdrawal of bFGF treatment. Fluorochrome-based analyses of periosteal and endocortical bone formation were inconclusive due to an inhibitory effect of bFGF on bone mineralization. However, a marked increase in fluorescent bone area was observed within the marrow cavity of bFGF-treated OVX rats during the withdrawal period. The results indicate that treatment of OVX rats with bFGF for only 7 to 14 days augments cortical bone mass and induces formation of bone spicules within the marrow cavity of the tibial diaphysis. These bone anabolic effects of the growth factor support its consideration as a potential osteoporosis therapy.\r\rPun S, Florio CL, Wronski TJ.\r\rReference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10913911</a>\r"
