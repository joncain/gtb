	<section>
		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Histidine</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Histidine is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids. Histidine is present in many proteins. L-histidine cannot be formed by other nutrients, and must be in the diet to be available to the body. Histidine is called a semi-essential amino acid (protein building block) because adults generally produce adequate amounts but children, especially infants, do not.
		</p>


		<div class="pageContentTitle">Histidine functions, uses, and health benefits:</div>

		<ul>
			<li>The body uses histidine to manufacture histamine, and histamine is responsible for a wide range of physiological processes.</li>

			<li>Histidine is needed to help grow and repair body tissues, and to maintain the myelin sheaths that protect nerve cells. It also helps manufacture red and white blood cells, and helps to protect the body from heavy metal toxicity. The stomach uses histidine to produce gastric juices.</li>

			<li>L-histidine may be indicated for use in some with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is known to be associated with low blood levels of histidine and elevated 3-methylhistidine. Histidine plays a significant role in the growth and repair of tissues, ulcers, hyperacidity, digestion, and gastric juices, as well as in the production of red and white blood cells.</li>

			<li>Histamine stimulates the secretion of the digestive enzyme gastrin. Without adequate histamine production healthy digestion can become impaired. Histidine is known to be vital in the maintenance of the myelin sheaths surrounding nerves, particularly the auditory nerve and is used to treat some forms of hearing disability.</li>

			<li>Histidine also acts to lower blood pressure and relax blood vessels, and is used to treat various cardiac and circulatory problems. Histidine is an essential component of zinc binding proteins and has an important role in the absorption and transport of zinc. Histidine in conjunction with zinc can increase zinc absorption from the gut.</li>

			<li>In its role as a zinc binding protein, histidine is important for the formation of myelin, a type of insulating fat which surrounds many nerve fibres. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons, it can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen.</li>

			<li>In carbonic anhydrases, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a zinc-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Histidine deficiency:</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			According to limited research, many people with rheumatoid arthritis have low levels of histidine. Histidine deficiency in babies causes eczema. Histidine deficiency can result in cataracts (diets that exclude Histidine result in Cataracts within three weeks). Histidine deficiency is suspected to be associated with stomach and duodenal ulcer.

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Isoleucine</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Isoleucine is an essential amino acid primarily used to boost energy, aid physical endurance and speed up recovery time after strenuous exercise.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Isoleucine is the fourth most abundant amino acid in human skeletal muscles, comprising about 12% of all proteins in the human body. As an essential amino acid, Isoleucine cannot be manufactured in the body and must be consumed through dietary sources or supplementation to maintain proper health.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Good sources of isoleucine include high-protein foods such as nuts, almonds, seeds, meat, cashews, eggs, fish, chicken, liver, lentils, peas, soy protein, brown rice and whole wheat bread products.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Isoleucine is highly concentrated in muscle tissue and is particularly important to serious athletes like bodybuilders and weightlifters.
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Blood levels of Isoleucine will fall significantly after strenuous exercise and will stay low until complete recovery. Supplementation with isoleucine one hour before strenuous workouts can reduce the recovery time by increasing muscle protein synthesis  and counteract catabolic (breakdown) processes.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Isoleucine is used for energy within the muscle tissue. A deficiency of isoleucine manifests symptoms similar to those seen in hypoglycemic patients, and may include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, depression, confusion, and irritability.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			All three BCAAs are essential in helping encourage muscle recovery after exercise. Isoleucine in particular keeps energy levels stable by helping to regulate blood sugar.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			BCAAs promote protein synthesis in muscle. They serve as important fuel sources for skeletal muscle during periods of metabolic stress. BCAAs are needed for the maintenance of muscle tissue and appear to preserve muscle stores of glycogen. BCAAs also help prevent muscle protein breakdown during exercise.
		</p>


		<div class="pageContentTitle">Benefits of Isoleucine</div>

		<ul>
			<li>Isoleucine helps maintain healthy and optimal levels of blood sugar and energy. As an amino acid, one of the building blocks of protein, it is needed for the formation of hemoglobin.</li>
			<li>This amino acid plays a key role in muscle recovery after exercise and in metabolism for producing energy. Isoleucine is broken down within muscle tissue to provide energy.</li>
			<li>It is also essential for the manufacture and synthesis of body proteins and is directly involved in blood clot formation.</li>
			<li>Isoleucine is required for nitrogen balance in adults and for the healthy, normal growth of infants.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Leucine</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Leucine is an essential amino acid, meaning you must obtain it through diet because your body can't produce it. You can acquire L-leucine by eating meat, dairy products, eggs, soy and other beans, or by taking it as a supplement. Leucine has potential benefits for weight, lean muscle mass and cholesterol levels.
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Muscle Maintenance</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Leucine, like other essential amino acids, helps maintain muscle mass. For this reason, many bodybuilders and athletes take leucine supplements. One study with animals published in the December 1, 2005 issue of the "Journal of Physiology" found that feeding aged rats leucine inhibited muscle protein breakdown. Another article in the journal discusses this research, explaining that although decreasing dietary fat is advisable for older people, continuing to eat high-quality protein is important.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Weight Loss Benefits</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Another animal study, this one appearing in the May 2009 issue of "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise," evaluated the effect of L-leucine along with exercise on weight loss in rats who previously ate a high-fat diet for 15 weeks. Researchers divided these rats into two exercise groups, with one group receiving leucine supplementation. Exercise combined with leucine had stronger effects on weight loss than exercise alone.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Cholesterol Levels</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			During the May 2009 "Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise" study, supplementing the rats with leucine also increased blood levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the so-called "good" cholesterol. Research published in the June 2007 issue of "Diabetes" investigated the effects on cholesterol levels in mice supplemented with leucine in drinking water. Leucine had no noteworthy metabolic effects on rats eating regular chow. It did produce significant effects on the group eating a high-fat diet compared with other mice eating the same diet without leucine supplementation. Consuming leucine resulted in up to a 32 percent decrease in weight gain and a 25 percent decrease in body fat in these mice, along with improving insulin sensitivity and preventing high blood sugar. The mice receiving leucine also experienced decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the "bad" cholesterol, of 53 percent and decreased total cholesterol levels of 27 percent.

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Lysine</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Lysine is an essential amino acid that cannot be manufactured in the bodies of animals. Only plants and bacteria are equipped with the ability to synthesize this crucial amino acid from aspartic acid. Lysine is an important constituent of all proteins found in the body. It is found in a small amount in cereals, while pulses are a significant source of lysine. Some important plant sources of lysine are soybean, berro, common bean, lentil, buffalo gourd, buckwheat and spinach. Besides these, meat, especially red meat, pork and poultry, eggs, cheese and some fish like cod and sardines are the rich sources of lysine.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Benefits of L-Lysine</div>
		<ul>

			<li>As an indispensable component of proteins, lysine plays many significant roles in the human body. It is crucial for the proper absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract. It also helps in conserving calcium. It facilitates the production of enzymes, hormones and antibodies and assists in the formation of muscle protein. Lysine aids in the synthesis of collagen, an important constituent of bones and connective tissues. Besides this, Lysine benefits involve stimulating the production of creatinine, which is responsible for converting fatty acids into energy. In the process, the level of cholesterol, especially the harmful LDL cholesterol, reduces in the body. An elevated level of LDL cholesterol is associated with the increased risk of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries due to deposition of fats inside the arterial wall).
			</li>
			<li>Lysine is often used in treating herpes viral infections, especially those caused by herpes simplex virus. It has been observed that lysine is effective in accelerating the process of recovery and reducing the frequency of both cold sores and genital herpes. It is also helpful in another viral disease known as shingles, which is characterized by skin rashes. As lysine facilitates the absorption of calcium, it may help in preventing osteoporosis. Besides these, lysine also prevents the excessive loss of calcium through urine. Certain forms of lysine are also believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, and hence, may be effective in alleviating pain. Some studies have revealed that lysine and arginine can activate the production of collagen, which is required for maintaining healthy bones, tendons and skin. Lysine along with vitamin C, alleviates the symptoms associated with the heart condition, known as angina pectoris. Lysine can also be helpful in migraines.
			</li>

			<li>Cold Sores
			<ul>
				<li>Lysine has be proven to be effective in helping treat cold sores. A study conducted by the Southern California University of Health Sciences showed lysine to be effective treatment in 40 percent of participants after three days and in 87 percent by the sixth day.  
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Shingles
			<ul>
				<li>Similar as with the treatment of cold sores, Lysine has be shown to accelerate recovery from shingles. The amino acid restricts replication of the virus and may also help maintain remission for some. Dosage may vary from person to person, so consult your physician or dermatologist to determine how this treatment can work for you.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Warts
			<ul>
				<li>Some topical creams used for the treatment of genital warts include lysine. While this may be successful for some, it is not recommended as the main treatment. Lysine can be used in conjunction with other medications during an outbreak or remission, but use should be doctor-supervised in case of adverse medicine interactions.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Deficiency of L-Lysine</div>

		<ul>
			<li>A deficiency of lysine can lead to the formation of kidney stones and other health problems such as nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite, fatigue, anemia and disorders associated with the reproductive system. A low-level of lysine can also lead to a low-level of the thyroid hormone, asthma and prolonged viral infections. As it is a vital amino acid, its deficiency can inhibit the normal rate of growth and development. However, we can get the required amount of lysine in our daily diet. It binds with sugar and therefore, in case of large intake of sugary cereals, the body finds it difficult to absorb lysine. In such cases, one may take lysine supplements.
			</li>
			<li>The bioavailability of lysine is reduced with food preparation methods, such as heating foods in the presence of a reducing sugar (ie, fructose or glucose); heating foods in the presence of sucrose or yeast; and cooking in the absence of moisture at high temperatures.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Methionine</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Methionine is a type of amino acid, which is what your body uses to make proteins and peptides.  Your body uses methionine to make the substance called creatine, another type of amino acid. Methionine also contains sulfur, which your body uses to promote healthy growth and metabolism. Another compound that your body makes from methionine is called s-adenosylmethionine or "SAMe," which has several important functions in your body. SAMe helps to support the normal function of your immune system, neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and melatonin, and your body's cell membranes.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Misconceptions</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Although methionine itself doesn't necessarily help to promote weight loss, the substance creatine that's made in your body from methionine might in fact help you to lose weight. In the supplement form of creatine, monohydrate, the methionine product could potentially help improve athletic performance and your body's ratio of muscle to fat.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Benefits</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Substances, such as histamine, which can cause allergic reactions and dilate blood vessels can affect the way the brain sends and receives messages. Methionine works to reduce histamine levels in the body to allow proper synaptic function. Deficiencies in methionine levels can lead to severe mental disorders such as dementia, and in supplement form it is often prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has also been shown as a promising agent to assist with memory recall and the treatment of other mental disorders such as Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease, and for patients suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults, fibromyalgia, and stress and anxiety.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Methionine supplements may help in supporting the liver and HIV/AIDS treatments, as well as help in treating Parkinson's disease. Although methionine isn't recommended for weight loss or exercise performance, the supplement could potentially help treat pancreatitis. The compound made from methionine known as SAMe could possibly help in treating depression, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis and liver disease. Aside from weight loss and sports performance enhancement, creatine supplements might also help in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or "ALS," chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or "COPD," muscular dystrophy, schizophrenia, congestive heart failure, high triglycerides, mitochondrial disorders and several other medical conditions.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Methionine is increasingly prescribed by alternative medical practitioners to boost protein levels for vegetarians and vegans who may not receive enough strictly through fruits, vegetables, and grains. It is also beneficial for those who metabolize large quantities of proteins, such as athletes. This amino acid is also often recommended as a protein replacement for people who are onsidered heavy drinkers.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Some common and significant side effects of methionine deficiency include liver damage, edema, weakness, and brittle hair. Low levels can slow normal growth and development in children. Insufficient levels in pregnant women may result in neural tube defects in infants, which are brain and spinal column disorders such as hydroencephaly or spina bifida.

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Phenylalanine</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid (building blocks for protein).  It is used to help combat pain (salicylic acid, a component of aspirin, is biosynthesized from phenylalanine).  It is also used as a stimulant, appetite suppressant, and mood enhancer.  Phenylalanine is used by the brain to produce norepinephrine (our brains' version of adrenaline), a neurotransmitter depleted by stress, caffeine, nicotine, pollution, and some pharmacological and recreational drugs.  Phenylalanine also helps replace dopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for feelings associated with sexual pleasure, confidence, and euphoria virtually side effect free.
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Phenylalanine is the precursor to another amino acid called tyrosine.  Tyrosine also does all of the above except for one factor -- chocolate (beta phenylethylamine), a neuromodulator associated with mood enhancement and sexual stimulation.  Tyrosine does not appear to be as active in this role as chocolate and DLPA.  This may be the reason some people refer to chocolate as sexual stimulant.  Unfortunately, all those extra calories from consuming the amount of chocolate needed for sexual stimulation would pile-on body fat in short-order.  If you are a chocoholic (for sexual stimulation or not) and want to lower your intake, phenylalanine or Fastin may be the answer for you.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">DL-Phenylalanine and Starbucks</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			D, L-Phenylalanine (or tyrosine) works especially well with caffeine.  Caffeine gives us a temporary lift by sending norepinephrine (neurotransmitter associated with mental sharpness, excitability, pain, and depression support) into the blood stream.  Over time, healthy levels of norepinephrine are depleted by caffeine and other factors mentioned above ... if not replaced.   Phenylalanine does a great job replacing this major neurotransmitter.
		</p>


		<div class="pageContentTitle">Cocaine</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Studies show that cocaine users who are trying to quit may benefit from D, L-phenylalanine (DLPA), theanine and/or glutamine use.  The chronic use of cocaine may eventually cause the side effects of depletion of dopamine and norepinephrine from the brain without replacing these two valuable neurotransmitters.  As dopamine is synthesized from precursors such as DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) and theanine, dopamine reserves are rebuilt, thus, overcoming the problem of dopamine depletion.  The use of DLPA on a regular basis may be a so-called "antidote" for those who are trying to quit cocaine.  One of cocaine's principal effects is the blocking of the re-uptake of dopamine in the brain.  This results in increased dopamine levels associated with the euphoric characteristic of the drug.  However, chronic use of cocaine may lead to considerable dopamine reduction.
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			In addition, cocaine users often exhibit various nutritional deficiencies (a myriad of side effects on their own).  Consequently, it is strongly suggested to provide certain vitamins and minerals to ones supplement protocol, particularly vitamin C, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxal phosphate (B6), magnesium, calcium, and zinc.  All of the above supplements are included in a multi-vitamin product called Life Extension Mix.  Vitamins B6 and C are important co-factors in the synthesis and structure of dopamine, serotonin and GABA.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Smokers</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Have you ever wondered why cigarette smokers enjoy "lighting-up" after sex?  There is evidence to support the notion that smoking appears to release dopamine into the brain.  As a result, smokers appear to get a mild hit of dopamine by "lighting-up" after an orgasm.  This may be one of the main reasons "kicking the smoking habit" is so difficult.  Cigarette smokers may find it quite easy to become ex-smokers with the use of phenylalanine.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Weight Loss</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Many ex-smokers gain weight right after quitting and use weight gain as a reason to keep smoking.  Phenylalanine encourages the hypothalamus in the brain to release CCK (cholecystokinin), the hormone responsible for signaling fullness.  Using phenylalanine may eliminate ex-smokers weight gain excuse virtually side effects free.
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Phenylalanine should not be confused with phenylpropanolamine (a form of amphetamine).  Phenylpropanolamine is an appetite depressant used in several over-the-counter diet pills.  It causes the brain to use up its stores of nor-epinephrine without stimulating it to produce more.  Typically, after about two weeks, the dieter stops taking the diet pill which can result in "the blues" and low energy since they are running low on norepinephrine.  They then gorge themselves on food and end up gaining more weight than before.

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Tryptophan</div>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and needs to be obtained from the diet. Like all other amino acids, tryptophan is used as a building block in protein synthesis. Additionally, tryptophan has a number of specialized functions, for example it is a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin and the vitamin niacin. Rich food sources are milk and dairy products, red meat, poultry, eggs, chocolate, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and peanuts. Tryptophan is also available as a food supplement.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Sleep Aid</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Tryptophan supplements are frequently taken as a sleep aid. In a 1982-1983 edition of the "Journal of Psychiatric Research," a review of the scientific evidence concluded that L tryptophan in doses of 1 gram or more produce an increase in subjective sleepiness and a decrease in the time to sleep. The researcher noted that the best results were obtained in subjects with mild insomnia or in normal subjects reporting a longer-than-average time to sleep.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Premenstrual Dysphoria</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome that can be debilitating due to either physical, mental or emotional symptoms. In a study at St. Mary's Hospital, Montreal, researchers gave 6 grams of L-tryptophan to premenstrual dysphoric disorder patients. After 17 days of treatment, starting at ovulation till the third day of menstruation, it was found that L-tryptophan significantly improved mood symptoms.
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Seasonal Affective Disorder</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Seasonal affective disorder, SAD, is a mood disorder in which people of otherwise normal mental health experience depressive symptoms in the winter, repeatedly year after year. Researchers at the University of British Columbia treated SAD patients with 3 grams of L-tryptophan daily for two weeks. The study found the L-tryptophan administration resulted in significantly reduced mean depression scores.
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Antidepressant</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, a hormone contributing to the feelings of well-being, and people with low levels of serotonin are prone to depression. A study reported in the November 1982, "Psychological Medicine," investigated whether tryptophan could act as an antidepressant. The study involved 150 patients and lasted 12 weeks. It was found that tryptophan significantly improved depression and was not associated with side effects

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Valine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Valine is an essential amino acid that is necessary for smooth nervous system and cognitive functioning. It is one of the three Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs), the other two being leucine and isoleucine.
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Valine Information</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Valine cannot be produced by the body and must be ingested through foods or supplements. Amino acids are essential for everyday body functions, as well as for maintaining muscle and regulation of the immune system. Valine is not processed by the liver, it is taken up by muscles.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Some foods that contain Valine include leafy vegetables, kidney beans, poultry and milk.
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Benefits of Valine</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Some of the benefits of Valine include improvement in insomnia and nervousness. It is also shown to improve disorders of the muscles, and is effective as an appetite suppressant.</li>
			<li>Valine also greatly benefits the regulation of the immune system. Perhaps the biggest benefits are experienced by athletes who perform long distance sports and bodybuilding. Valine is essential for muscle tissue repair and muscle metabolism, and also increases exercise endurance.</li>
			<li>Valine is commonly used by bodybuilders, in conjunction with isoleucine and leucine to promote muscle growth. It also provides energy and helps to repair tissues that are damaged during physical activity.</li>
			<li>Valine is necessary for muscle metabolism and growth of muscle tissue. It also helps remove potentially toxic excess nitrogen from the liver, and is able to transport nitrogen to other tissues in the body as needed. Valine may help treat liver and gallbladder disease, as well as damage to these organs caused by alcoholism and drug abuse. Valine may help treat or even reverse hepatic encephalopathy, or alcohol-related brain damage.  </li>
			<li>Because Valine is so essential for preserving, repairing and building muscle tissue, it is recommended for people involved with bodybuilding and other sports that require excessive use of the muscles.  Valine also helps prevent the breakdown of muscle by supplying the muscles with extra glucose for energy production during intense physical activity.</li>
			<li>Because Leucine helps increase endurance and energy and also promotes muscle tissue health and protection, it is essential for anyone who is serious about bodybuilding.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Alanine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Alanine, or L-alanine, is an amino acid that helps the body convert the simple sugar glucose into energy and eliminate excess toxins from the liver. Alanine has also been shown to help protect cells from being damaged during intense aerobic activity, when the body cannibalizes muscle protein to help produce energy.  
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>

		<ul>
			<li>Alanine is crucial for preserving balanced levels of nitrogen and glucose in the body, which it does through a series of chemical actions called the alanine cycle. During the alanine cycle, any excess amino acids (proteins) in cells or tissues are transferred to a receptor molecule called pyruvate, which is produced by the breakdown of glucose. The pyruvate is then converted to alanine and transferred to the liver. The liver extracts nitrogen from alanine and converts some of it back into pyruvate, which can then be used to produce more glucose. Any excess nitrogen is then converted into urea and passed out of the body during urination. This cycle, glucose—pyruvate—alanine—pyruvate—glucose, helps supply the body with the energy it needs to support cellular life. It also ensures that a constant supply of pyruvate is available to allow the synthesis of glucose and amino acids in the body.  Alanine may help regulate blood sugar as well. Research has found that for people with insulin-dependent diabetes, taking an oral dose of L-alanine effectively prevents nighttime hypoglycemia.</li>
			<li>Alanine is a nonessential amino acid, which means that a healthy body is able to manufacture its own supply of this substance. However, all amino acids may become essential (requiring dietary supplementation) if the body is for some reason unable to produce them. People with low-protein diets or eating disorders, liver disease, diabetes, or genetic conditions that cause Urea Cycle Disorders (UCDs), may need to take alanine supplements to avoid a deficiency. Low levels of alanine have been found in patients with hypoglycemia, diabetes, and hepatitis—it is not known at this time if alanine deficiency is the cause or result of these diseases. The body must have alanine to process the B vitamins so necessary for good health, especially vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine).</li>
			<li>Because fluid in the prostate gland contains alanine, it has been theorized that this amino acid may help treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition in which the prostate becomes enlarged and causes urination discomfort. In one study, participants with BPH took 780 milligrams of alanine, glycine, and glutamic acid per day for two weeks, then 390 milligrams of these three amino acids for the next two and a half months, and saw a significant reduction in symptoms.</li>

		</ul>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Side Effects</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			The only known side effect of beta alanine is tingling sensation on the skin. This is not harmful at all and is rather a nuisance if anything although some people actually like the sensation taking it for an indication that beta alanine is working on their muscles. The tingling is caused by beta alanine binding to nerve receptors and it is not experienced by everyone taking the amino acid. For those experiencing this, it lasts for about an hour in the first few weeks and subsides after a couple of weeks.

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Arginine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Arginine, or L-arginine, is an amino acid that is needed to keep the keep the liver, skin, joints, and muscles healthy. Arginine helps strengthen the body’s immune system, regulates hormones and blood sugar, and promotes male fertility. In addition, research has shown that this amino acid may improve circulation and treat impotence and heart disease.
		</p>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Arginine is considered a semi-essential amino acid because, although the body manufactures its own supply, there are times when dietary supplementation may be required, such as in the case of severe wounds or illness. In addition, newborns are not able to make their own supply of this substance, so arginine is considered essential in the first months of life.  
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Arginine stimulates the immune system by increasing the output of T lymphocytes (T- cells) from the thymus gland. Recent studies have focused on the potential of arginine as a treatment for AIDS, cancer, and other diseases linked to a depressed immune system.</li>
			<li>Arginine helps detoxify the liver by neutralizing the effects of ammonia and other toxic substances in the body. It is required for the generation of urea, which is needed for removal of toxic ammonia from the body during urination.</li>
			<li>Large concentrations of arginine are found in the skin, and this amino acid plays a key role in the health of all the body’s connective tissues, particularly the muscles. Arginine helps the body process both creatine, a natural substance that helps build muscle mass, and nitrogen, a chemical needed for muscle metabolism. Laboratory research suggests that arginine may help reduce body fat and speed up weight loss. Arginine has also been shown to help heal and repair damaged tissues, and thus may be beneficial to both athletes and those suffering from arthritis.  
			</li>
			<li>Arginine is involved in a variety of hormonal processes in the body. It stimulates the pancreas to release insulin, is used to make the pituitary hormone vasopressin, and regulates the production of growth hormone. In fact, the FDA has approved the use of intravenous arginine to evaluate those with suspected growth hormone deficiency.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Erectile Dysfunction</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			In a study published in a 1999 issue of "BJU International," researchers found that 5 g of L-arginine daily for six weeks improved the sexual function in men with erectile dysfunction.
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			L-Arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide (NO) in the human body. In the 1990s, scientists discovered that not only is NO an essential compound that helps blood circulation, but it is important to normal sexual function in both men and women. Without arginine there would be no NO, and without NO, men would not be able to have erections.
		</p>

			Both men and women report that L-Arginine seems to increase their libido or desire for sex, and some also report that L-Arginine gives them greater endurance and stronger, more powerful orgasms. Reports also suggest that L-Arginine supplements can improve fertility in men who have low sperm counts or poor sperm motility (activity).
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			The powerful effect of L-Arginine was illustrated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in the British Journal of Urology International in which researchers evaluated the nitric oxide levels of 50 men with erectile dysfunction. The men were given either L-Arginine or a placebo for six weeks. Nine of the 29 men (31%) given L-Arginine reported a significant improvement in their sexual performance. These nine men had low nitric oxide levels at the start of the trial, but their levels doubled by the end of the study.

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Asparagine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			The amino acid asparagine is a non-essential amino acid produced from the essential amino acid aspartic acid and ATP (adenosine triphosphate).  It is one of the principal and one of the most abundant amino acids involved in the transport of nitrogen. Asparagine is an amino acid required by cells for the production of protein.  
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Asparagine is known for its key role in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins.  Human nervous system also needs this amino acid to be able to maintain an equilibrium. Asparagine increases the resistance to fatigue and improves the smooth functioning of the liver. So, Asparagine benefits work best in the field of nervine health and liver protection.</li>
			<li>Currently, Asparagine is one of the twenty most common amino acids on our planet. It can be produced in the liver if aspartic acid and adenosine triphosphate is present and is recognized worldwide for its ability to help increase the resistance to fatigue, thus improving athletic stamina.</li>
			<li>This amino acid is actually an essential component of proteins involved in signaling, neuronal development and transmission across nerve endings. It is also necessary for transformation of amino acid from one form to another. In addition, Asparagine is known for its key role in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, as well as in the synthesis of many other proteins.</li>
			<li>People experiencing a deficiency of Asparagine may suffer from poor metabolism and show inability to manufacture and excrete urea, which is waste product of excess dietary protein. Such people thus may reveal symptoms like depression, confusion, and headaches. In addition, among the main benefits of Asparagine you can find the facts that it may help in metabolizing ammonia in the human body and enable proper functioning of the liver, as well as it enables a robust system resistant to fatigue.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Aspartic Acid</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Aspartic acid, also known as L-aspartate, is thought to help promote a robust metabolism, and is sometimes used to treat fatigue and depression. Aspartic acid plays an important role in the citric acid cycle, or Krebs cycle, during which other amino acids and biochemicals, such as asparagine, arginine, lysine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine, are synthesized.  
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>

		<ul>
			<li>Aspartic acid gets its reputation as a treatment for chronic fatigue from the crucial role it plays in generating cellular energy. Aspartic acid moves the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules from the main body of the cell to its mitochondria, where it is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the fuel that powers all cellular activity.</li>
			<li>In short, the more NADH a cell has, the more chemical fuel it produces, and the more energy you have to get through your day. (Some studies have shown that aspartic acid actually increases both stamina and endurance levels in athletes.) In addition, this amino acid helps transport minerals needed to form healthy RNA and DNA to the cells, and strengthens the immune system by promoting increased production of immunoglobulins and antibodies (immune system proteins).</li>
			<li>Aspartic acid keeps your mind sharp by increasing concentrations of NADH in the brain, which is thought to boost the production of neurotransmitters and chemicals needed for normal mental functioning. It also removes excess toxins from the cells, particularly ammonia, which is very damaging to the brain and nervous system as well as the liver.</li>
			<li>Aspartic acid is a non-essential amino acid, which means that the body is able to manufacture its own supply. It is also found in dairy, beef, poultry, sugar cane and molasses (the artificial sweetener aspartame is made from aspartic acid and phenylalaline, another amino acid). People with diets low in protein or with eating disorders or malnutrition may develop a deficiency, not only in aspartic acid, but in other amino acids as well, and experience extreme fatigue or depression.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Cysteine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Cystine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that helps form healthy skin, hair, bones, and connective tissue. It is also required to make glutathione, one of the natural antioxidants that fight free-radical damage (glutathione detoxifies the liver). Each molecule of cystine is made from two molecules of cysteine, another sulfur-containing amino acid that, as its name suggests, is very similar to cystine; in fact, cystine is generally regarded as the more stable form of cysteine, although both amino acids can be converted into the other as needed.  
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>

		<ul>
			<li>Cystine works closely with glutathione to remove toxins from the liver. In fact, cysteine is often used in emergency rooms to treat acetaminophen overdoses, which are known to cause liver damage. It also protects the liver and brain against toxins absorbed from alcohol and cigarette use, and may be effective in preventing hangovers.</li>
			<li>There’s a lot of cystine in alpha-keratin, the protein that makes up the fingernails, skin, and hair. For this reason cysteine supplements are sometimes marketed as anti-aging products that claim to stimulate the formation of collagen and improve skin elasticity. Cysteine supplementation may also help speed the healing of burns and wounds, and improve joint flexibility in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
			<li>Because it promotes the production of the antioxidant glutathione, cysteine supplementation may be useful to those suffering from conditions that have been linked to free-radical oxidative damage, such as hardening of the arteries and cancer. It may also help treat emphysema, tuberculosis, and bronchitis—cysteine has been shown to help break down mucus in the respiratory tract.</li>
			<li>Cysteine is more easily absorbed by the body than cystine, so most supplements contain cysteine rather than cystine. In addition, too much cystine in the body can cause cystinosis, a rare disease that can cause cystine crystals to form in the body and produce bladder or kidney stones. This side effect has not been associated with cysteine; however, as previously mentioned, cysteine is unstable, and is often converted to cystine in the body. To avoid the conversion of cysteine to potentially harmful amounts of cystine, it is advised that you take vitamin C supplements or consume citrus fruits along with cysteine supplements. Cystine cannot be used by the body without adequate amounts of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid, so you’ll want to make sure you get the right amount of these supplements as well. B vitamins are also needed to help the body get rid of homocysteine, a waste product that is formed when the body uses cysteine. Homocysteine has been linked to inflammation in the arteries that results in heart disease.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Glutamic Acid</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Glutamic acid, also called glutamate, is an excitatory neurotransmitter that increases the firing of neurons in the central nervous system. It is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and spinal caord. It is converted into either glutamine or Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), two other amino acids that help pass messages to the brain.  
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Glutamic Acid is important in the metabolism of sugars and fats, and aids in the transportation of potassium into the spinal fluid and across blood-brain barrier. Although it does not pass the blood-brain barrier as readily as glutamine does, it is found at high levels in the blood and may infiltrate the brain in small amounts. The brain can use glutamic acid as fuel.</li>
			<li>Glutamic acid is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the body.  It excites or stimulates the neurons in the nervous system enhancing brain and nervous system interaction.  Glutamic Acid is known to help correct personality disorders and is useful in treating childhood behavioral disorders. It is used in the treatment of epilepsy, mental retardation, muscular dystrophy, ulcers, and hypoglycemic coma, a complication of insulin treatment for diabetes. It is a component of folate (folic acid), a B vitamin that helps the body break down amino acids.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Glutamine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Glutamine is an amino acid or protein building block produced by the body. It serves a variety of functions in supporting the immune, digestive and nervous system and helps remove excess ammonia from the body.  Normal concentrations in a healthy individual are about 100,000 mg. Glutamine is maintained in the muscles.  Over 61% of skeletal muscle is Glutamine. Glutamine consists of 19% nitrogen, making it the primary transporter of nitrogen into your muscle cells. Deficiency causes the body to strip it from the muscles causing muscular decline or atrophy.  It is the most abundant amino acid in the body finding its concentrations in the muscles, brain, lungs, heart, kidney, liver, and gut lining.  It is a major fuel and energy source for the body and brain. Glutamine deficiency is common in most people and shows up as fatigue, chronic illness and mental acuity disorders.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Glutamine plays key roles in protein metabolism, cell volumizing, and anti-catabolism. Glutamine also increases your ability to secrete Human Growth Hormone, which helps metabolize body fat and support new muscle growth. Glutamine's anti-catabolism ability prevents the breakdown of your muscles.  It also helps regulate the body's pH, or the balance of acids and bases, required for the proper functioning of cells. It also helps regulate blood glucose levels and can be converted to glucose or energy for the body when needed.  Glutamine is involved in more metabolic processes than any other amino acid.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Glycine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Glycine is one of the non-essential amino acids and is used to help create muscle tissue and convert glucose into energy. It is also essential to maintaining healthy central nervous and digestive systems, and has recently been shown to provide protection via antioxidants from some types of cancer.
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Glycine is used in the body to help construct normal DNA and RNA strands—the genetic material needed for proper cellular function and formation. It helps prevent the breakdown of muscle by boosting the body’s levels of creatine, a compound that helps build muscle mass. High concentrations of glycine are found not only in the muscles, but in the skin and other connective tissues as well. Almost 1/3 of collagen, which keeps the skin and connective tissue firm and flexible, is composed of glycine. (High amounts of Glycine are also found in gelatin, which is a form of denatured collagen). Without glycine the body would not be able to repair damaged tissues; the skin would become slack as it succumbed to UV rays, oxidation, and free radical damage, and wounds would never heal.</li>
			<li>Glycine is considered a glucogenic amino acid, which means it helps supply the body with glucose needed for energy. It helps regulate blood sugar levels, and thus glycine supplementation may be useful for treating symptoms characterized by low energy and fatigue, such as hypoglycemia, anemia, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).</li>
			<li>Glycine is essential for a healthy, normally functioning digestive system. It helps regulate the synthesis of the bile acid used to digest fats, and is included in many commercial gastric antacid agents.</li>
			<li>Glycine is necessary for central nervous system function. Research has shown that this amino acid can help inhibit the neurotransmitters that cause seizure activity, hyperactivity, and manic (bipolar) depression. Glycine can also be converted to another neurotransmitter, serine, as needed, and may be beneficial in the management of schizophrenia. In one study, twenty-two schizophrenic patients, who did not initially respond to traditional treatments, added glycine to their ongoing antipsychotic medication and found that it significantly reduced their symptoms. Glycine intake among the participants ranged from 40 to 90 grams daily (0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight). More research concerning the effects of glycine on schizophrenia is underway. Studies have shown that glycine also helps improve memory retrieval loss in those that suffer from a wide variety of sleep-depriving conditions, including schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, jet lag, and overwork.</li>
			<li>Results from preliminary studies of glycine as a potential treatment for cancer have been promising, and suggest that it may help prevent the development of cancerous tumors and melanoma. In laboratory mice, dietary glycine prevented tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenisis, the process by which tumors develop their own blood supply. Glycine also seems to play a role in keeping the prostate healthy. In one study, glycine was shown to help reduce the symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia in men.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Ornithine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Ornithine is a non-essential amino acid derived from the breakdown of arginine during the citric acid cycle. It helps build muscle and reduce body fat, especially when combined with the amino acids arginine and carnitine. Ornithine is also needed for the formation of citrulline, proline, and glutamic acid, three amino acids that help supply energy to every cell in the body.  
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Ornithine is often combined with arginine and marketed to body builders as a muscle-building supplement. Laboratory studies have shown that ornithine increases both insulin and growth hormone levels, which are needed to build and maintain muscle during intensive physical training. Ornithine may also help combat the muscle loss that is a normal part of the aging process. As the body ages, it is less efficient at synthesizing proteins and can’t regenerate muscle tissue as quickly—strength and muscularity begin to decline. By helping to elevate growth hormone levels, ornithine may help speed the production of muscle tissue and offset the effects of aging. Although both arginine and ornithine help protect and build muscle mass, ornithine is generally thought to be twice as effective at stimulating growth hormone production as arginine, so a combination supplement is not necessary if you wish to use ornithine for this purpose.  </li>
			<li>Ornithine helps remove toxic ammonia from the liver, and may reduce the effects of cirrhosis of the liver and disorders associated with liver malfunction. In one study, participants taking 18 grams of ornithine aspartate for two weeks showed significant improvement in blood tests and liver function compared to the placebo group. Research has also shown that ornithine helps promote healing and tissue repair. Clinical studies reported that taking 10 grams of ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) each day helped reduce the length of hospital stays for those recovering from surgery, generalized infections, cancer, trauma, and burns.  </li>
			<li>If you have cirrhosis of the liver, taking an L-ornithine supplement could potentially help to prevent hepatic encephalopathy, notes the University of Michigan Health System. Hepatic encephalopathy is an often fatal complication of cirrhosis. A 2008 study published in the "Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology" found that taking L-ornithine-l-aspartate helped to treat or prevent hepatic encephalopathy, according to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A similar study published in the "Journal Metabolic Brain Disease" in 2002 found the same results.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Proline</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Proline is an amino acid needed for the production of collagen and cartilage. It keeps muscles and joints flexible and helps reduce sagging and wrinkling that accompany UV exposure and normal aging of the skin.
		</p>
		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Proline helps the body break down proteins for use in creating healthy cells in the body. It is absolutely essential to the development and maintenance of healthy skin and connective tissues, especially at the site of traumatic tissue injury. Proline and lysine (another one of the amino acids that is important to protein synthesis) are both needed to make hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, two amino acids that form collagen. Collagen helps to heal cartilage and to cushion the joints and vertebrae. For this reason, proline supplementation may prove beneficial for treatment of conditions such as osteoarthritis, persistent soft tissue strains, and chronic back pain.</li>
			<li>The body needs proline to maintain muscle tissue as well. Decreases in proline levels have been noted in prolonged endurance runners and others following prolonged exercise. Serious athletes that subject their body to routine, rigorous workouts may want to take a supplement containing proline in order to avoid loosing muscle mass—the body begins to cannibalize its muscle for energy when glucose supplies run low. Proline is a nonessential amino acid. The body makes proline from glutamic acid, and deficiency is rare in healthy individuals with a healthy diet. However, people recovering from traumatic injury, particularly skin injuries such as severe burns, may want to supplement this amino acid. People with pain caused by insufficient cartilage or collagen formation could benefit from extra proline in their diet as well.</li>
			<li>Arteriosclerosis, a condition that results in a stiffening of your arteries, is a leading cause of heart disease. This is due to a loss in the elasticity of your blood vessels due to the inhibition of collagen formation in the soft tissues that make up the walls of your vessels. The ability for proline to form collagen in your arteries may be blocked due to the buildup of cholesterol and calcium along your arterial walls. High levels of proline may increase your body's resistance to arteriosclerosis by ensuring the continuation of collagen formation, even when your cholesterol levels in your blood are elevated.</li>
			<li>High levels of serum proline found in your bloodstream may reduce blood pressure by breaking up deposits of cholesterol and fatty acids along the walls of your blood vessels. Proline enables the walls of your blood vessels to release fat buildups, decreasing the size of blockages in your heart and surrounding vessels. Proline acts as a type of lubricant, which can decrease the ability of fat globules to stick to your arterial walls; this may reduce your risk for developing heart disease and lessen the effects of a heart attack or stroke.</li>

			Serine is a non-essential amino acid derived from the amino acid glycine. It is important to overall good health, both physical and mental. Serine is especially important to proper functioning of the brain and central nervous system.  
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Serine helps form the phospholipids needed to make every cell in your body. It is also involved in the function of RNA and DNA, fat and fatty acid metabolism, muscle formation, and the maintenance of a healthy immune system. The proteins used to form the brain, as well as the protective myelin sheaths that cover the nerves, contain serine. Without serine, the myelin sheaths could fray and become less efficient at delivering messages between the brain and nerve endings in the body, essentially short circuiting mental function.</li>
			<li>Serine is also needed to produce tryptophan, an amino acid that is used to make serotonin, a mood-determining brain chemical. Both serotonin and tryptophan shortages have been linked to depression, insomnia, confusion, and anxiety. Research suggests that low levels of serine may contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM).</li>
			<li>Serine helps produce immunoglobulins and antibodies for a strong immune system, and also aids in the absorption of creatine, a substance made from amino acids that helps build and maintain all the muscles in the body, including the heart.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Taurine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			L-taurine, also referred to simply as taurine, is a non-essential amino acid. It is considered non-essential because adults can produce taurine.  According to Dr. Elson M. Haas in his 1992 book "Staying Healthy with Nutrition," if not enough taurine is produced in your body nor consumed in your diet, supplementation may be required. Taurine has a role in dozens of your bodily functions and is beneficial in both healthy and diseased states.
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Taurine plays an important role in many aspects of your cardiovascular system. This amino acid helps to move key nutrients, such as potassium, magnesium and calcium, in and out of your heart's cells to improve its functioning. Low levels of taurine have been found in patients who suffered a heart attack. Haas discusses the use of taurine in Japan for sufferers of ischemic heart disease. Multiple daily doses of taurine improved cardiac function in patients suffering from a variety of chronic heart conditions, such as arrhythmia, congestive heart failure and heart attacks.</li>
			<li>Taurine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter which can act as a sedative for excitable brain states, according to Haas. The sedative effect can be useful to prevent seizures in epileptics and to minimize manic states if you suffer from bipolar disorder.</li>
			<li>The results of a study by Yutaka Nakaya of the Tokushima University School of Medicine and a team of researchers in Japan, published in 2000 in the "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition", demonstrate the role of taurine in the dilation of the vascular system. Taurine supplementation can increase secretion of nitric oxide, which dilates your blood vessels and improves blood flow and delivery of oxygen to your muscles.</li>
			<li>Taurine can lower your cholesterol by improving gallbladder function which can then eliminate cholesterol through bile, according to Haas. The results of the study by Nakaya and his team provide evidence for this role--the taurine supplementation reduced liver and blood cholesterol levels in the treated group.</li>
			<li>Taurine functions as a "potent" antioxidant, according to Nakaya's study. Free radicals attack cells in your body and can cause chronic conditions such as cancer, eye disease, and possibly diabetes. Taurine can help to protect your body from free radical damage, as noted by both Nakaya and Haas.</li>
			<li>Haas mentions that other benefits of taurine include treatment for male infertility, cirrhosis and depression. Additionally, the results of the Nakaya team's study suggest taurine supplementation may be beneficial if you suffer from type 2 diabetes.</li>

		<div class="pageContentSectionHeader">Tyrosine</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid that helps regulate mood and stimulates the nervous system. It can also help speed up the metabolism and treat conditions characterized by chronic fatigue.
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			The body needs adequate supplies of tyrosine to make many important brain chemicals that help regulate appetite, pain sensitivity, and the body’s response to stress. It is also needed for normal functioning of the thyroid, pituitary, and adrenal glands—low levels of tyrosine may lead to hypothyroidism, low blood pressure, chronic fatigue, and sluggish metabolism.  
		</p>

		<div class="pageContentTitle">Health Benefits</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid or protein building block derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. It is also found in a variety of dietary sources such as poultry, fish, nuts, seeds and dairy products. It functions as a precursor to a variety of neurotransmitters and molecules in your body, and it is also available as a dietary supplement if you have a phenylalanine metabolism disorder. Tyrosine also may be useful in treating depression and attention deficit disorders, among other conditions. Consult a physician before taking tyrosine supplements to avoid complications.</li>
		</ul>


		<div class="pageContentTitle">Neurotransmitter Development</div>
		<p class="pageContentText">
			Tyrosine is an important building block for several neurotransmitters, including epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine. Sufficient production of these neurotransmitters depends on adequate tyrosine levels in your body. Dopamine serves many functions in your cardiovascular, endocrine and central nervous systems, and it may be converted into norepinephrine or epinephrine. These two neurotransmitters play a large role in your body's fight or flight response, such as increased heart rate and blood flow to your muscles
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			The body needs both tyrosine and an the essential amino phenylalanine to make epinephrine, dopamine, and norepinephrine, three neurotransmitters that basically control the way you perceive and interact with your environment. Without adequate amounts of phenylalanine, the body can’t manufacture it’s own supply of tyrosine; without adequate amounts of tyrosine, the body cannot metabolize phenylalanine. A shortage of either of these amino acids could leave you vulnerable to a host of mental disorders, including anxiety, depression, low libido, and chronic fatigue. Tyrosine supplements, especially when combined with 5-HTP (5-hydroxy-tryptophan) supplements, have been used successfully to treat depression. Tyrosine supplementation has also been used for treatment of allergies, headaches, Parkinson’s disease, and drug withdrawal.
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			Tyrosine is involved in the production of melanin, thyroid hormones and enkephalins in your body. Melanin is a pigment that provides color to skin and hair that helps in protecting the body from harmful ultraviolet rays. Tyrosine acts as a precursor to several thyroid hormones that regulate metabolism, growth and development. Tyrosine also helps produce pain-relieving substances in your body called enkephalins
		</p>

		<p class="pageContentText">
			There are some people, however, that have a condition that makes it impossible for them to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine, which is called phenylketonuria (PKU). For these people tyrosine is an essential acid, and supplementation is necessary.
